# Rush 01 - Piscine

Conquering the next level of programming challenges, Rush 01 builds upon the foundation laid in Rush 00. This project delves deeper into the intricacies of C, pushing Piscine participants to:

- Master advanced data structures: Explore dynamic memory allocation, linked lists, and trees to efficiently manage complex data.
- Tackle memory management: Understand how memory works in C, employing malloc, free, and pointers with precision.
- Unleash the power of functions: Design modular, reusable functions that encapsulate logic and enhance code clarity.
- Embrace recursion: Conquer the concept of recursion, solving problems by calling functions within themselves.
- Challenge algorithms: Implement and optimize algorithms like mergesort and quick sort to handle large datasets.
- Embrace the Norm: Adhere to 42's strict coding standards (Norm) for consistent, professional code.

Rush 01 is a testament to your dedication and growth as a programmer. It signifies your ability to handle complex C concepts, design efficient solutions, and adhere to professional coding standards. This project is a stepping stone towards mastering C and unlocking your potential as a developer.
