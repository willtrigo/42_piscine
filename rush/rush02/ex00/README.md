# Rush 02 - Piscine

Conquering the next level of programming challenges, Rush 02 is a challenging project within 42's Piscine that delves deeper into file input/output (I/O) and data structures. This project pushes you to:

- Master file I/O: Write functions to efficiently read and write data.
- Conquer data structures: Implement and utilize advanced data structures like linked lists, stacks, and queues to organize and manage data effectively.
- Optimize memory usage: Develop an understanding of memory management and utilize techniques like dynamic memory allocation to optimize memory usage.
- Handle errors gracefully: Implement robust error handling techniques to handle file access errors and unexpected situations.
- Design modular functions: Break down complex tasks into smaller, well-defined functions for improved code readability and maintainability.
- Test and debug code: Apply rigorous testing and debugging practices to ensure code functionality and identify potential issues.

Completing Rush 02 demonstrates your ability to handle complex file I/O and data structures with confidence. This project equips you with essential skills for building robust and efficient programs that interact with data stored in files. It also marks a significant milestone in your journey as a C programmer.
